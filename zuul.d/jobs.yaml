# NOTE(cloudnull): META JOB MAP
# In order to cater for the possibility that an external job was dependent on the old job name
# the following job items are used to repoint work to the updated job name should the old name
# be referenced. As we updated our zuul dependencies and external job runners these items should
# be removed as soon as they're no longer needed.
